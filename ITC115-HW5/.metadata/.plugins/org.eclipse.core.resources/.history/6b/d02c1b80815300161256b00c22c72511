Coin Calculator Pseudocode. 

0. Give a greeting. 
1. Ask the user if they want to play (y/n). 
2. If 'y', go into while loop. 
3. If any response aside from 'y' (either case), don't go into while loop, 
and end the program. 
4. Give an ending message, and terminate the program. 

while loop! 

a. Ask user for the number of cents they want to enter; range: 0-99. 
We didn't learn error handling yet, so expect the app to calculate if you 
put in a number outside the range, and to throw an exception if a BOOL or 
STRING is entered. 
b. 4 coins - quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies. 

QUARTERS: 
c. Quarters counted first. If cents >= 25, then quarters = cents/25.
d. Take the remainder, and put into another variable. 
e. cents2 = cents%25. 

DIMES:

NICKLES:

PENNIES:
